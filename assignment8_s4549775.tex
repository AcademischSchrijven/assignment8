\section{Abstract}
In this paper I present an easy to understand and follow approach to detect an object's position, and the direction it is facing, from visual input using OpenCV. This is done as a case study of an autonomous football playing robot.

\section{Introduction}
For a university project I wanted to detect the position of a robot and which way it was facing, as well as the position of a ball, using visual input. I looked into computer vision frameworks and eventually chose OpenCV. I expected there to be some prebuilt functionality for something as mundane as detecting an arrow but was disappointed.

In this article I want to present the approach I took to detect the features I needed; and how this was applied in a robotics project. This article is positioned as an introduction into image detection and does not assume familiarity with the subject. Concepts and terminology are introduced as needed; it serves as a quick overview over image detection and OpenCV in particular.

\section{Problem}
As input for my robot's decision making algorithm I need the position of the ball, as well as the position of the robot, and the direction it faces. The ball is round, so direction does not really apply to it.

For this purpose I mounted a camera above the playing field facing straight down. The ball is a bright yellow, and on the robot I mounted a bright red arrow, pointing forward.

So the problem we need to solve is the following: Given visual input with unique, and brightly colored objects, how can the positions and directions of the objects be extracted?

\section{Overview over Computer Vision}
Computer Vision is the field of study that deals with the extraction of high level features from digital visual data. In our case this data is the video stream from the camera, and the features are the positions and directions of the ball and car.

There are many applications for Computer Vision, most of which are concerned with automation of tasks previously done by humans. In our case playing football, though there are of course more practical applications as well. Tesla heavily invests in Computer Vision for its application in self driving vehicle technology.
